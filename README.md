jquery-switcher
=============

A handy little jquery plugin to make switches akin to the iOS 6 UISwitch
control. Take alook at the examples in ./example to see how it's used.

![Example](http://f.cl.ly/items/0p3y2n3P2C3l3C472B35/Screen%20Shot%202013-02-03%20at%2017.13.28.png)

### Compilation

None of the source is compiled in a ready to use form, to do this you'll need to
make sure you have [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed.

- `git clone git@github.com:tarnfeld/jquery-switcher.git`
- `cd jquery-switcher`
- `make`

Then open one of the two examples in your browser and try it out!

### Browser Support

Currently all animation is done using CSS3 transitions, and with the `-webkit` prefix. This
will change.
